<h1 align="center">Hey! I'm Conny, nice to meet you üëãüèº</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am a software developer - yes! I know - <b>unexpected</b>.</h3>
<div>Anyway, I'm working together with @namespace-media for quite some time now on the video game "encrypt." and some smaller projects on my own.</div>

## Check out my Projects
## encrypt.
"encrypt." is a competitive platformer! Build your own stages or play stages from the community and compete with other players! "encrypt." brings back Retro-Game feelings with modern Pixel-Graphics. We can promise you, this Game will offer you a lot of fun and a nostalgic atmosphere!

## CTils Suite
The CTils library suite is a set of libraries with which I try to make my workflow less repetitive.

<b>You probably know it:</b>
- In the past, you have written the same code with the same functions etc. in your projects over and over again.
- Or you have small differences in your projects due to repetitive writing of the same code over and over again which makes all your projects feel like they were written by different developers.

The CTils suite is still small, but it will only grow over the next months and years.
### Projects and MCR
#### CTils - jTrack
jTrack is a small and powerful library for collecting data of tracks.
